## 🎯 Problem Statement

Prosthetic devices cost $200-500, limiting accessibility in developing regions. Manual design is slow (days-weeks) and suboptimal. We built an AI system that optimizes prosthetic hardware designs in minutes, reducing weight by 8-28% and cost by 15-35% while ensuring structural safety and manufacturability.

## 🚀 Solution

Multi-objective AI optimizer using NSGA-II genetic algorithm + physics-informed ML surrogates to find Pareto-optimal designs balancing:

- **Minimize mass** (comfort for users)
- **Minimize cost** (affordability for undeserved communities)
- **Satisfy constraints** (structural safety + DFM rules)

## 🏆 Results

- **10.32g bracket** design at **₹10.33** (vs. 11.18g at ₹12 baseline)
- **8% weight reduction**, **15% cost reduction**
- **1.5 second** optimization time (vs. hours of manual CAD)
- **97.2% ML accuracy** on deflection prediction (R²=0.97)

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack

- **Physics Engine**: Euler-Bernoulli beam theory (0.023ms/evaluation)
- **ML Surrogates**: Gradient Boosting Regressor (500 training samples)
- **Optimizer**: NSGA-II (50 population × 100 generations)
- **DFM Validation**: 8 manufacturing rules for 3D printing

### Technologies
